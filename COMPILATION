How to compile an application to run under Sniper
=================================================

All options are defined in ${SNIPER_ROOT}/config/buildconf.<format>
where <format> is:

* sh: for inclusion in shell-based build scripts:
    source ${SNIPER_ROOT}/config/buildconf.sh

* makefile: for inclusion in make-based builds:
    include ${SNIPER_ROOT}/config/buildconf.makefile


Single-threaded and Pthread applications
----------------------------------------

* No source code modifications necessary
* Link with the SNIPER_LDFLAGS options
* Run with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to SNIPER_LD_LIBRARY_PATH



To compiler with newer version of GCC/G++ (5.0+), add this flag to the compiler:

-fabi-version=2

example:

export CXXFLAGS='-fabi-version=2'
